                <p style="font-size: 20px;">In the Science Mission Directorate (SMD), 
                    the Astrophysics division studies the universe. The science goals of the SMD Astrophysics 
                    Division are breathtaking: we seek to understand the universe and our place in it. We are 
                    starting to investigate the very moment of creation of the universe and are close to learning
                     the full history of stars and galaxies. We are discovering how planetary systems form and how 
                     environments hospitable for life develop</p>

                ASTROGEOLOGY<br><br>
                 <img src="./astrogeo.jpg" style="height: 250px; width: 390px;">
                 <p style="font-size: 20px;">Astrogeology is concerned with the geology of the solid bodies in the solar system, 
                    such as the asteroids and the planets and their moons. Research in this field helps scientists
                     to better understand the evolution of the Earth in comparison with that of its neighbours in the solar system. 
                     This subject was once the domain of astronomers, but the advent of spacecraft has made 
                     it accessible to geologists, geophysicists, and geochemists. The success of this field of study has depended 
                     largely on the development of advanced instrumentation.</p>

                    ASTROBIOLOGY<br><br>
                    <img src="./astrobio.png" style="height: 250px; width: 450;">
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Astrobiology involves the search for life outside Earth. It also asks the questions: What 
                        is the origin and evolution of life? Is there life on other planets? Which environments can support life?
                        .Astrobiology pulls from astrochemistry to better understand substances in celestial bodies, 
                        stars, and interstellar space. Observing molecules in space gives a solid indication of the physical conditions 
                        of what we are used to on present-day Earth.</p>

                    ASTROMETRY<br><br>
                     <img src="./astrometry.png" style="height: 250px; width: 390px;">
                     <p style="font-size: 20px;">Instead of the physics that drives motion in space, astrometry focuses on 
                        the precise position of celestial bodies. It also provides a frame of reference for the movement of stars 
                        and individual objects in space.
                        On a similar note, exoplanetology inventories how many and where planets exist outside of our solar system. 
                        This inventory of planets lists all potential residences for new life outside of Earth.</p>
