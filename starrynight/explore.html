                Astronomy, science that encompasses the study of all extraterrestrial objects and phenomena. 
                Until the invention of the telescope and the discovery of the laws of motion and gravity in the 17th century,
                astronomy was primarily concerned with noting and predicting the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets, originally 
                for calendrical and astrological purposes and later for navigational uses and scientific interest.

                    A central undertaking in astronomy is the determination of distances. Without a knowledge of astronomical distances, the size of an observed object in space would remain nothing more than an angular diameter and the brightness of a star could not be converted into its true radiated power, or luminosity.

                The solar system took shape 4.57 billion years ago, when it condensed within a large cloud of gas and dust. Gravitational attraction holds the planets in their elliptical orbits around the Sun. In addition to Earth, five major planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) have been known from ancient times.

                Early observers looking at the night sky noticed patterns in the stars . These patterns, which we call constellations, might appear to change place, but they don’t change shape. People around the world gave them names (like  Orion the hunter or Leo the lion) and told stories about them. You may know some of these stories as myths, or as astrology. Astrology can be fun to think about, but it’s different from astronomy. Astrology is not science! 

Early observers also noticed some bright objects in the sky that seem to wander around among the stars. The ancient Greek philosophers called these objects “planets,” which is Greek for “wanderers.” The planets are our near neighbors, and they do move. They orbit the Sun , just as Earth does.<br><br>
            To the naked eye, the stars look like tiny points of light . But stars are not tiny—they're huge, burning balls of gas, like our Sun. They just appear small because they are so far away. The nearest star to our solar system is 4 light years away, which is 20 trillion miles.
